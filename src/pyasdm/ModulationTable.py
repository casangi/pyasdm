class ModulationTable:
    """
    The ModulationTable class is an Alma table.

    A table to hold antenna dependent LO frequencies or their offsets and additional related parameters.

    Shown here are the fields found in each row.

    The key fields are shown first and used (together) to index a unique row. Key fields
    are all required and indicated by "Key." following the description.

    Other fields are required unless "optional" is shown for that field.

    The field description text here is as found in the model used to generate the code.

    Types may be an enumeration or extended pyasdm type. Fields that are python lists
    are indicated that by "[]" in the type and having the word "Array" at the start of
    description followed by the expected number of elements in that list in parentheses.
    Lists (arrays) may be multi-dimensional (lists of lists) and are indicated
    by [][] ... etc as needed to indicate the expected number of
    dimensions. Multi-dimenstional lists will show the expected number of elements
    for each dimension also in the parenthese after "Array".

    The use of "auto-incrementable" indicates that that field is auto-generated
    when the table is created and that field is set, as necessary, to create a
    unique key for the specific row being added, by incrementing that value from
    the previous highest value needed for the rest of the elements of the key on
    that row. Such a field can not be set independently, it is only set when
    the row is added to the table by that auto-increment mechanism.

    Attributes:



        antennaId (Tag): refers to a unique row in AntennaTable. key.



        receiverId (int): receiver identifier. key.



        spectralWindowId (Tag): spectral window identifier. key.



        timeInterval (ArrayTimeInterval): time interval for which the row's content is valid. key.





        localOscillatorOffset (Frequency): LO offset.

        walsh180enabled (bool): is Walsh 180 enabled?

        walsh90enabled (bool): is Walsh 90 enabled?




        walsh180index (int): index for the 180 degree Walsh function pattern. Optional.

        walsh90index (int): index for the 90 degree Walsh function pattern. Optional.
